## A simple fuel script for FiveM.


Note: This script was made mostly with chatgpt. I do not take full credit as I did use that for a lot of it but I did do some of it myself and I am publishing it for free for people to enjoy or use.
If you do not condone the usage of chatgpt or AI tools then just don't use the script. The intentions were for my personal use but I figured people who are new(and experienced) might want to try it out and use it.
I have tested it in a local FiveM server and it seems to work pretty good so far. A little bit of testing with other players worked good, too. I have not tested the performance/optimization so if there are any memory leaks
or issues I am not responsible. I will however, take constructive criticism and/or feedback to make changes to improve the script.

**Features:**
-Standalone Script  
-Simple installation  
-Very customizable, has config file where you can change a lot of stuff to your liking!  
-Press E / Horn on keyboard (by default) or LB / L3(click left thumbstick) to turn off your vehicle when in range of the gas pump.  
-Then, hold Spacebar (by default) or A / X (on xbox controller) to start filling your vehicle up.  
-Press your throttle key/gas to turn your vehicle on and you're good to go!  
-You can pickup a jerry can and fill up your vehicle anywhere. Each fill up takes 5 seconds and fills 50% of a gas tank (configurable)  
-Has features put in place to prevent miss-hap like overfueling, fueling when not needed etc.  
-Stores info based off of vehicles model ID (unique per vehicle) and *should* sync per vehicle and each player gets same fuel rating when getting in drivers seat.  
-Highly configurable HUD for both getting gas and jerry can (they're linked so changing one changes the other).  
-Fuel drains based on your speed, and a small static idle amount is drained automitcally when the vehicle is on. you do not lose any fuel if your vehicle is off.  
-Draining, Refueling, etc. is all configurable!

Enjoy :)
